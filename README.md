# mbr-for-nmt

## Characterizing minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding for neural machine translation (NMT)

This project characterizes the performance of MBR decoding for NMT when using various candidate generation methods, by examining BLEU score, length bias, and token frequency bias in resulting translations. The project motivation, goals, and results are described below. The final project paper, which contains a full project description, can be found [XXXhereXXX](insert-link-here).

This repository contains the dataset used for the project, code to reproduce results and analyses, and saved results. The folders and files of this repository are described in detail below.
